It's not very good, yet.
I'm trying to learn React.

This repository has separate branches:
 - [dev](https://github.com/zsarge/website/tree/dev)
   - This is where I write and test the code
 - [gh-pages](https://github.com/zsarge/website/tree/gh-pages)
   - This is where I push the code to be hosted on https://zsarge.github.io/website/
